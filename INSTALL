There are two complete implementations of the program included in the
source distribution. One is coded in C and uses a simple Makefile, while
the other is implemented in rust as an exercise in both writing rust and
porting from one language to the other. Which to install is up to the
user.

=================
  The C version
=================
Quick install:
	make
	make install
This installs the program as /usr/local/bin/cslt and manual page as
/usr/local/share/man/man1/cslt.1

For fine tuning several variables can be changed from their defaults by
editing config.mk or by specifying them on the command line.

PROGNAME - sets the name of the installed program and manual page (slut)
PREFIX   - sets the installation prefix (/usr/local)
BINDIR   - where to install binaries ($(PREFIX)/bin)
MANDIR   - where to install manuals ($(PREFIX)/share/man

====================
  The Rust version
====================
You will need an up-to-date rust toolchain including cargo.
Quick install:
	cargo build --release
	install -s target/release/rslt /usr/local/bin

===================
  The Zig version
===================
You will probably need the development version of the Zig toolchain.
Quick install:
	zig build -Drelease-safe=true
	install -s target/release/zslt /usr/local/bin
